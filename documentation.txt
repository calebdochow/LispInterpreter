Limitations:

Only NIL is false; all other values are considered true inconsistently.

Only integers, doubles, strings, symbols, NIL, and cons cells supported.

Arithmetic operations fail if operands are not numbers.

Operations solely use 2 arguemnts, requires nesting for larger computations

and/or short-circuit but truthiness rules differ from standard Lisp.

Errors return NIL rather tahn crashing the program
